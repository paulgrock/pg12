p Hi, I'm Paul. I do the front end development thing. CSS, HTML, javascript and jQuery with some RoR mixed in are my weapons of choice. When I'm not being a total web nerd I'm out and about playing basketball, reading sci-fi/fantasy books, getting killed constantly at FPSs or hanging out watching whatever movie is in my netflix queue.
